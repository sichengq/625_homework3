Description: A custom implementation of linear regression modeling using QR decomposition. 
             This package aims to replicate the core functionality of R's built-in lm() 
             function, allowing users to understand the mechanics behind linear model fitting. 
             Key features include calculating coefficients, residuals, and fitted values 
             while providing flexibility for weighted least squares and model diagnostics.
